This program takes any alignment in .FASTA format and splits the sequences up by position in the codon.  The output is three files with the alignment parsed by position in the codon.  The user should know when the reading frame starts (pos.1,2 or 3 in the alignment) as the program puts position 1,4, 7, etc, of the alignment into the first file.  This program is ideal for preparing alignment files for testing models of molecular evolution by codon position for phylogenetics using a standard model testing program.
